Changes in log4sh 1.5.X
=======================

Changes with 1.5.1
------------------

Fixed brown-bag error which prevented the default stdout appender from printing
anything.

Unset additional variables that were missed.

Fixed off-by-one in exit value for scripts exits caught with trap.

Major directory restructuring. Simplifying to match that of shUnit2 and
shFlags.

Upgraded shUnit2 to 2.1.5.

The code base is split from one large script into smaller more manageable
pieces that also allow for easier testing and for future expansion (say a
DatabaseAppender perhaps).


Changes with 1.5.0 (since 1.4.0)
--------------------------------

Removed all deprecated functions

Remove old non-unit-test tests

Removed extra parameters that were being wrongly passed to the
``appender_setType()`` and ``appender_setLayout()`` functions

Removed the ``appender_activateOptions()`` call when caching the appender

Made the ``/dev/urandom`` random number generator the default when the
``mktemp()`` function is present

Consolidated appender data get/set requests with new ``_appender_getData()``
and ``_appender_setData()`` functions

Added return values to all functions [where it makes sense]

Added return value checking in *many* locations

Updated shUnit to 2.1.0pre

Made the ``Makefile`` much more generic so it can be used with other projects

Replaced the DocBook archive extraction functionality with script that will
properly download and extract the DocBook sources so building the DocBook
documentation will be easier.

Moving to use `reStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
for documentation.

Fixed the ``Makefile`` so that calling ``make docs`` will properly download the
appropriate DocBook XML and XSLT files before attempting to build the docs.

Renamed the ``__LOG4SH_TRUE``, ``__LOG4SH_FALSE``, and ``__LOG4SH_ERROR}``
variables to the same without the leading underscores (e.g. ``LOG4SH_TRUE``).
Scripts using log4sh should have access to these.

Fixed bug when attempting to log a message at an invalid logging level with the
log() function. It should have returned an error, but it didn't.

Fixed bug where the 'B' unit was not recognized for the MaxFileSize of a
RollingFileAppender
