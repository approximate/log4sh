MAJOR CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS

All deprecated functions present in the 1.4.x series have been removed.

The process of getting the Docbook documentation built has been greatly
improved. A script is now included to download the appropriate Docbook sources
with which the documentation can be built.

See the CHANGES-1.5.txt file for a full list of changes.

None.

KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

Passing of the '\' character in an logging message does not work under the
standard Solaris Bourne shell [/bin/sh], under the dash shell [/bin/dash], or
under Cygwin with ksh [/bin/ksh].

The DailyRollingFileAppender appender do not roll files.

Trap handling is not yet absolutely 100% fool-proof.

Performance is prohibitively slow under Cygwin

More error checking/reporting needs to be added; this includes validating input
to public functions.
