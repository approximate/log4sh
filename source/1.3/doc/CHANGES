Changes with 1.3.0

*) [kwd] implemented logging to syslog by using the logger command.  currently
limited to the localhost

*) [kwd] ported the new {get|push|pop}ThreadName functions from 1.2.7

*) [kwd] implemented a SMTP appender based on code supplied by Mickael Canevet.
the appender is still in development.

*) [kwd] implemented a new way to handle the string arrays.  the old method
worked just fine, except for when the data contained space characters.  this
new method handles spaces as well (which are needed for the SMTP appender
subjects).


Changes with 1.2.6

*) [kwd] made some variable names in documentation a bit more readable

*) [kwd] fixed bug #XXX - insecure /tmp file


Changes with 1.2.5

*) [kwd] defined the __LOG4SH_APPENDER_DAILY_ROLLING_FILE variable as it for
some reason was not defined


Changes with 1.2.4

*) [kwd] added docbook documentation

*) [kwd] added documentation and code to build the docbook documentation

*) [kwd] fixed the sample usage comments as they worked only for log4sh 1.1

*) [kwd] set all of the __LOG4SH_* constants to readonly

*) [kwd] replaced appender_setAppend() function with appender_close() to better
match functionality of log4j

*) [kwd] added ALL logging Level to better match log4j

*) [kwd] added return codes to most functions for standardization

*) [kwd] changed how log4sh was sourced in the test scripts so they would work
under solaris


Changes with 1.2.3

*) [kwd] included LGPL-2.1 license for the first official distribution

*) [kwd] fixed the test-log4sh script so it works again

*) [kwd] fixed many small bugs in log4sh found while fixing the test script

*) [kwd] added initial website to source as a means of documentation


Changes with 1.2.2

*) [kwd] changed the configuration environment variable name from
LOG4SH_PROPERTIES to LOG4SH_CONFIGURATION to match log4j better


Changes with 1.2.1

*) [kwd] added support for a log4sh.properties file (not complete)

*) [kwd] added support for %r conversion character.  returns seconds as opposed
to milliseconds


Changes with 1.2.0

*) [kwd] none; this release is identical to release 1.1.5


Changes with 1.1.5

*) [kwd] added support for the %c conversion character.  when used, it will be
replaced with the word 'shell' as there is no concept of a class within shell.


Changes with 1.1.4

*) [kwd] added support for thread name.  by default, the value is empty, but
it can be set using the logger_setThreadName method.  support for the %t
conversion character in the pattern layout is also provided.


Changes with 1.1.3

*) [kwd] added support for the following conversion characters in pattern
layouts:
  %F - filename (set via logger_setFilename function)

*) [kwd] began adding some function documentation

*) [kwd] added appender_setPattern function to allow changing of the default
pattern layout for an appender.

*) [kwd] added a private function _appender_getIndex that will return the
index position of a named appender.  written so some code duplication can be
eliminated in a couple of functions.


Changes with 1.1.2

*) [kwd] no longer leaves shell in mode where unset variables cause errors

*) [kwd] added appender_getLevel() method

*) [kwd] added very basic support for patterns - a default pattern to be more
specific of "%d %p - %m"


Changes with 1.1.1

*) [kwd] added __LOG4SH_RELEASE variable

*) [kwd] moved somewhat into a structured project


Changes with 1.1.0
