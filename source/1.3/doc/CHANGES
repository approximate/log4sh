Changes with 1.3.1

*) [kwd] added a __LOG4SH_VERSION variable

*) [kwd] implemented a more secure method for using temporary files.  if the
TMPDIR variable is set, it is honored.  the method is based on info from
http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/115462/151/.

*) [kwd] prefixed all the new array functions with _log4sh.  didn't think about
it for the last release.  oops.

*) [kwd] replaced many 'awk' statements with 'cut' statements.  resulted in
about 10% faster performance while testing with the test-log4sh unit test
script.

*) [kwd] added a TRACE debug level.  log4j-1.2.12 added this, so I did too.
actually, just renamed my ALL debug level to TRACE, so nothing *really*
changed.

*) [kwd] renamed the file, smtp, and syslog functions to make future fuction
additions easier

*) [kwd] reordered and regrouped the functions according to what they are for

*) [kwd] stripped the setting and unsetting of temporary variables from many
functions where they are simple enough to be understand without them

*) [kwd] abstracted several array gets into functions to allow for future
underlying array implementation changes

*) [kwd] replaced nearly all usages of the old array system with the new system


Changes with 1.3.0

*) [kwd] implemented a Syslog appender for logging via syslog by using the
logger command.  currently limited to the localhost

*) [kwd] ported the new {get|push|pop}ThreadName functions from 1.2.7

*) [kwd] implemented a SMTP appender based on code supplied by Mickael Canevet.
the appender is still in development.

*) [kwd] implemented a new way to handle the string arrays.  the old method
worked just fine, except for when the data contained space characters.  this
new method handles spaces as well (which are needed for the SMTP appender
subjects).
