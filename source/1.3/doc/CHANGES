Changes with 1.3.2

[kwd] removed the last reminants of the old array implementation that was used
for the __log4shAppenders variable.  the new implementation is now used
consistently throughout.

[kwd] fixed bug in the popThreadName function.  the current thread name was
being filled with the wrong value.

[kwd] added the (deprecated) commands appender_setAppenderFile() and
appender_setSyslogFacility() back to be backwards compatible with the 1.2 series

[kwd] increased performance in the log() function (credits to Omner Calhoun)

[kwd] fixed bug in the log4sh_readProperties() function that broke it under
Solaris


Changes with 1.3.1

[kwd] added a __LOG4SH_VERSION variable

[kwd] implemented a more secure method for using temporary files.  if the
TMPDIR variable is set, it is honored.  the method is based on info from
http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/115462/151/.

[kwd] prefixed all the new array functions with _log4sh.  didn't think about it
for the last release.  oops.

[kwd] replaced many 'awk' statements with 'cut' statements.  resulted in about
10% faster performance while testing with the test-log4sh unit test script.

[kwd] added a TRACE debug level.  log4j-1.2.12 added this, so I did too.
actually, just renamed my ALL debug level to TRACE, so nothing *really*
changed.

[kwd] renamed the file, smtp, and syslog functions to make future fuction
additions easier

[kwd] reordered and regrouped the functions according to what they are for

[kwd] stripped the setting and unsetting of temporary variables from many
functions where they are simple enough to be understand without them

[kwd] abstracted several array gets into functions to allow for future
underlying array implementation changes

[kwd] replaced nearly all usages of the old array system with the new system

[kwd] fixed *many* reported bugs (credits to Omner Calhoun)

[kwd] the various logging commands now support multiple arguments (very much
like the echo command).  as a result, the input no longer needs to be
surrounded by quotes.  (credits to Omner Calhoun)

[kwd] realized that while internally, practically all of the get* functions use
index numbers, there is the need to use the appender name as well.  added a
appender_syslog_getFacilityByName function (as an example) and renamed the old
function to appender_syslog_getFacilityByIndex.  must continue this work in the
future.

[kwd] begin implementing a type of documentation in the code...  will extract
the documentation at build time from the code which will be used to build API
documentation.  wrote a extractDocs.pl script to do the documentation
extraction.  it's written in perl, I know, but log4sh is still in shell!

[kwd] changed the functionality of the code in several places so that internal
shell commands are used instead of forking off an external command.  (credits
to Omner Calhoun)

[kwd] I'm sure there are others that were forgotten


Changes with 1.3.0

[kwd] implemented a Syslog appender for logging via syslog by using the logger
command.  currently limited to the localhost

[kwd] ported the new {get|push|pop}ThreadName functions from 1.2.7

[kwd] implemented a SMTP appender.  the appender is still in development.

[kwd] implemented a new way to handle the string arrays.  the old method worked
just fine, except for when the data contained space characters.  this new
method handles spaces as well (which are needed for the SMTP appender
subjects).
