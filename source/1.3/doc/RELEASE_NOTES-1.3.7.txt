CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS

There seems to be slowly growing interest in log4sh, so the time has come to
start tracking some bugs more officially in the bug tracking of SourceForge.
The few bugs that were reported for this release have been entered into the
tracking system for the sake of posterity.

BUG FIXES

There were some small bugs reported by users with the SMTPAppender and
SyslogAppender that were fixed.

There were as well a tiny issue with the dash shell that required some source
rearrangement. The dash shell also did not like the dummy functions used in
shUnit, so they had to be slightly altered.

Bug# 1611574

DEPRECATED FEATURES

KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

Passing of the '\' character in an logging message does not work under the
standard Solaris shell [/bin/sh] or under Cygwin with ksh [/bin/ksh].

The RollingFileAppender and DailyRollingFileAppender appenders do not roll
their files.

Trap handling is not yet 100% fool-proof.

Performance is prohibitively slow under Cygwin

The SyslogAppender does not allow the sending of messages to a remote host.

More error checking/reporting needs to be added; this includes validating input
to public functions.
