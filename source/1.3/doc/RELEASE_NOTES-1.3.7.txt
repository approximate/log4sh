RELEASE NOTES FOR 1.3.7

This release of log4sh continues to fill out the planned functionality of the
1.3 series. It adds some more unit tests, as well as fixes some bugs reported
by users.


TESTED PLATFORMS

Cygwin – bash 3.1.17(6); pdksh 5.2.4

Linux – 3.1.17(1); dash 0.5.3; ksh 1993-12-28

Solaris 10 U2 – /bin/sh; bash 3.00.16(1); ksh M-11/16/88i


NEW FEATURES

Added dash to the list of supported shells.


CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS

There seems to be slowly growing interest in log4sh, so the time has come to
start tracking some bugs more officially in the bug tracking of SourceForge.
The few bugs that were reported for this release have been entered into the
tracking system for the sake of posterity.

Additional unit tests: SyslogAppender

Logging to remote hosts via syslog now supported. Requires setting 'nc'
alternative command path as the nc (netcat) command is not present by default
on most systems.

The RollingFileAppender now works properly. Files are rotated based upon a
maximum file size, and the number of backup files can be limited with a maximum
backup index.


BUG FIXES

There were some small bugs reported by users with the SMTPAppender and
SyslogAppender that were fixed.

There were as well a tiny issue with the dash shell that required some source
rearrangement. The dash shell also did not like the dummy functions used in
shUnit, so they had to be slightly altered.

The subject was not being set properly in the SMTPAppender.

Bug# 1611574 -- 'unbound variable' error

Bug# 1614338 -- SyslogAppender not logging


DEPRECATED FEATURES

None.


KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

Passing of the '\' character in an logging message does not work under the
standard Solaris Bourne shell [/bin/sh], under the dash shell [/bin/dash], or
under Cygwin with ksh [/bin/ksh].

The RollingFileAppender and DailyRollingFileAppender appenders do not roll
their files.

Trap handling is not yet 100% fool-proof.

Performance is prohibitively slow under Cygwin

More error checking/reporting needs to be added; this includes validating input
to public functions.
