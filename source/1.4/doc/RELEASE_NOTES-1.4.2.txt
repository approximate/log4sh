CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS

Upgraded shUnit to shUnit2-2.1.1pre as it supports skipping and has a needed
bugfix not present in the latest release version.


BUG FIXES

log4j support wasn't working when a fully qualified class name (e.g.
org.apache.logging.PatternLayout) was used.

The log4sh_readProperties() function was not properly calling
log4sh_doConfigure().


DEPRECATED FEATURES

None.


KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

Passing of the '\' character in an logging message does not work under the
standard Solaris Bourne shell [/bin/sh], under the dash shell [/bin/dash], or
under Cygwin with ksh [/bin/ksh].

The DailyRollingFileAppender appender do not roll files.

Trap handling is not yet absolutely 100% fool-proof.

Performance is prohibitively slow under Cygwin

More error checking/reporting needs to be added; this includes validating input
to public functions.
