CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS

The log4sh_doConfigure() function now calls log4sh_resetConfiguration() before
loading a new configuration.

Added Mac OS X 1.4 as a tested platform.

Additional unit tests:
+ testSMTPAppender


BUG FIXES

Alternative commands configured in a config file caused errors when read.

The SMTPAppender did not send mail properly when the Subject contained spaces.


DEPRECATED FEATURES

None.


KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

Passing of the '\' character in an logging message does not work under the
standard Solaris Bourne shell [/bin/sh], under the dash shell [/bin/dash], or
under Cygwin with ksh [/bin/ksh].

The DailyRollingFileAppender appender do not roll files.

Trap handling is not yet absolutely 100% fool-proof.

Performance is prohibitively slow under Cygwin

More error checking/reporting needs to be added; this includes validating input
to public functions.
