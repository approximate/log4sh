KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

Passing of the '\' character in an logging message does not work under the
standard Solaris Bourne shell [/bin/sh], under the dash shell [/bin/dash], or
under Cygwin with ksh [/bin/ksh].

The DailyRollingFileAppender appender do not roll files.

Trap handling is not yet absolutely 100% fool-proof.

Performance is prohibitively slow under Cygwin

More error checking/reporting needs to be added; this includes validating input
to public functions.
