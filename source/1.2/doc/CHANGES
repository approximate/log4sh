Changes with 1.2.10

[kwd] backported the _log4sh_mktempDir() function from the 1.3 series.  it
attempts to use the native mktemp function if it is available on the system. if
the function is not available, it falls back to using the RANDOM variabl if it
is available.  if not, it finally defaults to generating a semi-random number
that is a combination of the date and PID.

[kwd] fixed bug that caused '&' characters in the logging message to be
replaced with '%m'.


Changes with 1.2.9

[kwd] removed extraneous call to logger_getLevel from logger_addAppender
(reported by Omner Calhoun)

[kwd] backported a serious bugfix from 1.3.3pre.  when log4sh is configured
from a properties file, there are problems when declaring more than one
appender when there are no spaces after the commas in the rootLogger
declaration.  (thanks to Gordon Pedersen for indirectly finding this)


Changes with 1.2.8

*) [kwd] added a __LOG4SH_VERSION variable

*) [kwd] implemented a more secure method for using temporary files.  if the
TMPDIR variable is set, it is honored.  the method is based on info from
http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/115462/151/.


Changes with 1.2.7

*) [kwd] implemented logger_getThreadName, logger_pushThreadName, and
logger_popThreadName based on suggestions and a patch from Dan Johansson.


Changes with 1.2.6

*) [kwd] made some variable names in documentation a bit more readable

*) [kwd] fixed bug #1232236 - insecure temporary file creation


Changes with 1.2.5

*) [kwd] defined the __LOG4SH_APPENDER_DAILY_ROLLING_FILE variable as it for
some reason was not defined


Changes with 1.2.4

*) [kwd] added docbook documentation

*) [kwd] added documentation and code to build the docbook documentation

*) [kwd] fixed the sample usage comments as they worked only for log4sh 1.1

*) [kwd] set all of the __LOG4SH_* constants to readonly

*) [kwd] replaced appender_setAppend() function with appender_close() to better
match functionality of log4j

*) [kwd] added ALL logging Level to better match log4j

*) [kwd] added return codes to most functions for standardization

*) [kwd] changed how log4sh was sourced in the test scripts so they would work
under solaris


Changes with 1.2.3

*) [kwd] included LGPL-2.1 license for the first official distribution

*) [kwd] fixed the test-log4sh script so it works again

*) [kwd] fixed many small bugs in log4sh found while fixing the test script

*) [kwd] added initial website to source as a means of documentation


Changes with 1.2.2

*) [kwd] changed the configuration environment variable name from
LOG4SH_PROPERTIES to LOG4SH_CONFIGURATION to match log4j better


Changes with 1.2.1

*) [kwd] added support for a log4sh.properties file (not complete)

*) [kwd] added support for %r conversion character.  returns seconds as opposed
to milliseconds


Changes with 1.2.0

*) [kwd] none; this release is identical to release 1.1.5
