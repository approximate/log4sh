Changes with 1.1.5

*) [kwa] added support for the %c conversion character.  when used, it will be
replaced with the word 'shell' as there is no concept of a class within shell.


Changes with 1.1.4

*) [kwa] added support for thread name.  by default, the value is empty, but
it can be set using the logger_setThreadName method.  support for the %t
conversion character in the pattern layout is also provided.


Changes with 1.1.3

*) [kwa] added support for the following conversion characters in pattern
layouts:
  %F - filename (set via logger_setFilename function)

*) [kwa] began adding some function documentation

*) [kwa] added appender_setPattern function to allow changing of the default
pattern layout for an appender.

*) [kwa] added a private function _appender_getIndex that will return the
index position of a named appender.  written so some code duplication can be
eliminated in a couple of functions.


Changes with 1.1.2

*) [kwa] no longer leaves shell in mode where unset variables cause errors

*) [kwa] added appender_getLevel() method

*) [kwa] added very basic support for patterns - a default pattern to be more
specific of "%d %p - %m"


Changes with 1.1.1

*) [kwa] added __LOG4SH_RELEASE variable

*) [kwa] moved somewhat into a structured project


Changes with 1.1.0
